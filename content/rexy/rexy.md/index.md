## History of Rexy

The first drafts of Rexy was created in early 2021 by [Amber Bardell].  At the time she was just a logo for {{% metarex %}} but since then Rexy has grown as a character, with her own personality and backstory, had various artwork and vidoes made of her adventures and even been made into a soft toy! 

Her adventures are far from over, so be sure to follow on the {{% insta %}} for the latest artwork by Amber and Simi!

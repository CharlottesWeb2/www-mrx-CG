## How Rexy the soft toy came to be

The Creative Team at MetaRex had been talking about getting a soft toy of [Rexy] made for a while. 

After much research and discussion, the start of the project began in May 2024 and Rexy finally become a living, ‘breathing’ soft toy in August 2024, ready for her big debut at IBC 2024 and to be the winning prize of the {{% metarex %}} [Treasure Hunt].

    src = "rexy-plane.png"
    alt = "rexy on a plane"
    text = "Rexy on her first ever plane journey!"
/>}}

Rexy was the main star of the MetaRex Treasure Hunt 2024 and was won by the amazing [Amy Rajonson].

In order to design and make soft toy Rexy, we used the incredibly talented team at [Picture to Puppets], a small, independent company based in Edinburgh, UK, where they make custom, personalised puppets and soft toys.
 
Throughout the whole process, the team at Picture to Puppets were brilliant and so helpful.  Giving us various options for the colour of Rexy’s skin and style of her hair, allowing us the time to decide the best fabrics, and keeping us updated on each stage of the making process, so we knew how our little Rexy was coming along!   

Many thanks to the whole team at Picture to Puppets.  It was wonderful to have Rexy brought to life and be able to capture her character. 

Here are some of the orginal storyboard ideas and design for Rexy soft toy:

{{< fo t = "image"
    src = "/rexy-area/soft-toy/rexy-sketch.png"
    srcWidth = "0.5"
    text = "Design sketch of Rexy"
    alt = "sketch of Rexy"
/>}}

{{< fo t = "image"
    src = "/rexy-area/soft-toy/rexy-skin-sample.png"
    srcWidth = "0.5"
    alt = "rexy skin sample"
/>}}

{{< fo t = "image"
    src = "/rexy-area/soft-toy/rexy-tuff-hair.png"
    srcWidth = "0.5"
    alt = "Rexy tuff of hair"
/>}}
